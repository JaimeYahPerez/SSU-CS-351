# Project-1 Report
1. The program that seemed to be the fastest was the alloca.cpp program, which showed fast results for most of the tests, except when it came to optimizer tests, where malloc.cpp outperformed alloca.cpp. There were also instances where the two tests tied.
2. list.cpp seemed to be the slowest program with new.cpp occassionally tying it like in the data per node trials where at 8 nodes, new.cpp was slower, and at 256 they were tied.
3. There is a clear pattern with the increase of time execution in the data per node in which, the time performance of the tests scaled with the size of data each node had. Although the rankings of the programs still stayed the same
